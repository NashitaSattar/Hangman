# Hangman
This is a classic Hangman game implemented in Python. Play against the computer by guessing letters to figure out the hidden word before you run out of chances!

In this version of Hangman, the computer selects a random word from a predefined list. The player then tries to guess the word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess brings the player one step closer to losing the game.
